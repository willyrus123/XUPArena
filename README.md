### Project Description: XUPArena

**Overview:**
XUPArena is a decentralized betting platform designed to offer a secure, transparent, and efficient way to place bets on various events. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, particularly the XRP Ledger and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain, XUPArena ensures that all bets and transactions are immutable, traceable, and executed without intermediaries.

**Key Features:**

1. **Decentralized Betting:**
    - Users can place bets on various events such as sports, eSports, and other competitive events.
    - The platform operates on smart contracts, ensuring transparency and fairness in all betting activities.
2. **Secure Wallet Integration:**
    - Users can connect their digital wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to the platform for seamless transactions.
    - Supports deposits and withdrawals in XRP and other supported tokens.
3. **Admin Panel:**
    - Admins can add new events, declare winners, and manage tokens directly from the admin interface.
    - Events can be customized with team names, odds, and dates.
4. **Real-Time Bet Tracking:**
    - Users can view their bet history, including details like category, teams, odds, amount, and status.
    - Bet history is dynamically updated and stored on the blockchain for transparency.
5. **Odds Management:**
    - Admins can set and update odds for different events, providing users with accurate and up-to-date information.
